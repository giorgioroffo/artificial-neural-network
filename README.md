Data analytics for a bank:

To make this dataset, the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank.  

Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (based on the customer churn dataset).
