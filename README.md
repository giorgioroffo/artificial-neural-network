# Template implementation of an Artificial Neural Network in keras 


### Note: This repository contains homework assignments for the Artificial Intelligence course at the University of Glasgow, created while I served as the assistant lecturer and held a postdoctoral position, focusing on Python, deep learning, and associated tools.


Dataset:

To make this dataset, the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank.  

You can find here a template implemtentation of an Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (based on the customer churn dataset). 

The network includes dropout regularizationand parameter tuning.
